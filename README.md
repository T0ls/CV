Guide to use Token Authentication:
    After you dowloaded all the files, 
    go to "LINK" and create a new token key (if you have trouble creating a auth key follow this tutorial "LINK")
    if you already have a key you can skip this passage mentioned before
    now edit the api_token.js file changing the placeholder with your token.
    save and you are ready, your profile info will be taken from the token, ENJOY!
